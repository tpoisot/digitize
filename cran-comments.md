This is a re-submission of the previous digitize package with a new maintainer.

Previously, the package was archived on CRAN. Tim, the previous maintainer, is
no longer reachable at email tpoisot@um2.fr . His new email is
tim@poisotlab.io. I (jashander@ucdavis.edu) am taking over maintaining the
package with Tim's permission. (Tim and I have discussed this with Kurt Hornik by email
most recently on 2016-08-20).
